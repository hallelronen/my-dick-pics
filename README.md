First of all, I don’t know where to post this. There’s no sub-forum for digital flashing…. 

Today I received a text message with a picture of some dude’s dude parts. I’m livid. The message with it said “Tina, would you send me something sexy? Please?” My name is not Tina. However, it is an unusual name that starts with a T and has the other letters in it, and many people have come up with many many nicknames. I don’t remember specifically whether anyone ever called me Tina, but I feel like it has happened. I’ve been with my Fiance for over 2 years, and it’s hard to remember anything about any other guys before him because I never have any reason to think about them. I hate to say that I can think of a few ex boyfriends who’re not above something like this, but I don’t have their numbers any more. The picture shows a tall narrow mirror, and the reflection is a profile with the unmentionables, half a leg, a stomach, a hand, and a phone. Evidently he doesn’t mind if I know his number, but he’s afraid to show his face. 

So I have one specific question, and then I’m looking for some good advice. 

1) Is there any way I can find out exactly who is the holder of this cell phone number without having to contact him back? Has anyone tracked down a cell numbr successfully? I have a couple friends who’re cops, is it worth it to ask them? I don’t want to make this into a big thing, and they’re not close friends, so I’ll only ask if they can definitely help. If it’s a stupid ex, fuck em. But if it’s someone I see regularly, whom I consider to be a safe person to be around, I definitely want to know immediately. 

2) I haven’t told Fiance. He had to fly across the country today for 3 days, and I know it would have upset him. Nothing like this has happened before, so I don’t know if he would get angry, insecure, etc. but I didn’t want to cast that shadow before he left. He’s such an innocent happy guy, I don’t want him to feel like anything is being threatened. But if people think I should tell him, let me know. The picture downloaded automatically, so it’s currently on my phone with the message. I don’t want to delete it yet in case something crazy happens and I need to back up my story. I’m planing on deleting it before he gets back, but if for whatever reason he found it, I wouldn’t want to have to explain not telling him in the first place. 

3) Should I say anything back? I’ve considered some options: 

Silence – you can’t shake me, asshole
“Never. Coward.” – nothing that could be misconstrued as flirty, nothing ambiguous, not letting him think what he did was no big deal 
“Should’ve waited ’til puberty hit” – no better way to wound his ego, am I right? 
“Posting this online with your phone number” – make him nervous 
“Who is this?” – if he thinks I might be receptive, he might tell me…? 
HELP! I’m just really distraught by this. Both in a visceral autonomic sense and in the cognitive sense. I can’t believe someone thinks this is ok. I can’t believe I was forced to be on the receiving end of this exchange without any say in the matter. Gah…. anything else anyone wants to contribute is welcome, my brain isn’t very coherent right now. I also narrowly avoided being hit by two separate cars within 1 hour today, so bullshit tolerance is real low right now….
